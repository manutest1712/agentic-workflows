You know everything about Texas.

Answer the prompt based on this knowledge, not your own.
Final Answer:
Certainly! There are two places in Texas historically known as "Rome":

1. **Old Rome (Rome, Texas in Dallas County):**
   - **Location:** Near present-day Grand Prairie, in Dallas County.
   - **History:** Rome was established in the 1850s as a small community and stagecoach stop along the Fort Worth-Dallas road. It had a post office from 1857 to 1867. The town declined after the Texas and Pacific Railway bypassed it in the 1870s, leading to its eventual disappearance. Today, nothing remains of Old Rome, and it is considered a ghost town.

2. **New Rome (Rome, Texas in Wise County):**
   - **Location:** Near the present-day city of Rhome, in Wise County, northwest of Fort Worth.
   - **History:** Originally called "Prairie Point," the community was renamed "Rhome" (sometimes spelled "Rome") in the late 1800s after a local landowner, Byron Crandall Rhome. The town grew as a stop on the Rock Island Railroad and became a small agricultural and shipping center. Today, Rhome is an incorporated city with a population of several thousand.

**Summary:**
Rome, Texas, refers to two historical communities: one in Dallas County (now vanished) and one in Wise County (now known as Rhome). Both played roles as early settlements and transportation stops in North Texas history.

Final Answer:
Certainly! Rome, Italy, has a history spanning over 2,700 years and is one of the most influential cities in European and world history.

**Ancient Rome:**
Rome was traditionally founded in 753 BCE. According to legend, it was established by Romulus and Remus. It began as a small settlement on the Palatine Hill and grew into the Roman Kingdom, then the Roman Republic (509–27 BCE), and finally the Roman Empire (27 BCE–476 CE). During the Republic, Rome expanded its territory across the Italian peninsula and later throughout the Mediterranean. The Empire saw Rome become the capital of a vast territory stretching from Britain to the Middle East and North Africa. The city was renowned for its architecture, engineering, and as a center of law and governance.

**Late Antiquity and Middle Ages:**
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE, Rome experienced decline and was repeatedly sacked. However, it remained significant as the seat of the Papacy. During the Middle Ages, Rome was a center of Christian pilgrimage and the Papal States, ruled by the Pope, controlled the city and surrounding region.

**Renaissance and Baroque Periods:**
Rome flourished during the Renaissance (15th–16th centuries) and Baroque (17th century) periods, becoming a center of art, culture, and architecture. Popes commissioned works from artists like Michelangelo, Raphael, and Bernini, transforming the cityscape with churches, palaces, and fountains.

**Modern Era:**
In the 19th century, Rome became a focal point of the Italian unification movement (Risorgimento). In 1870, it was annexed by the Kingdom of Italy and became the capital of unified Italy in 1871. The 20th century saw further growth and modernization, as well as the Lateran Treaty of 1929, which established Vatican City as an independent state within Rome.

**Today:**
Rome is the capital of Italy and a major European city, known for its historical sites such as the Colosseum, Roman Forum, and Vatican City. It remains a center of culture, religion, and politics in Europe.

Use only the following knowledge to answer, do not use your own knowledge:
You know everything about math, you take prompts with numbers, extract math formulas, and show the answer without explanation

Answer the prompt based on this knowledge, not your own.
Final Answer:
Given:
\( f = 2 + \frac{3}{5} \times 38 \)

Calculate:
\( \frac{3}{5} \times 38 = \frac{3 \times 38}{5} = \frac{114}{5} = 22.8 \)

So,
\( f = 2 + 22.8 = 24.8 \)

Final answer:
f = 24.8
