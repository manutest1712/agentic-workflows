Product Specification Document
Email Router
1. Introduction
1.1 Business Overview
Our organization handles a high volume of incoming email communications that require timely, accurate responses across multiple departments. Currently, manual email triage and routing creates bottlenecks, delays customer responses, and consumes valuable staff time that could be directed toward higher-value activities.
Team members spend significant portions of their workday sorting through emails, determining appropriate handlers, and forwarding messages—a process that introduces inconsistency in response quality and timing. Subject matter experts often receive misdirected inquiries, while routine questions that could be automated consume unnecessary attention.
The introduction of the Email Router system addresses these operational challenges by implementing AI-powered email analysis and routing. This solution will integrate with our existing email infrastructure to automatically categorize incoming messages, generate responses for routine inquiries, and intelligently route complex communications to the appropriate subject matter experts.
By implementing this system, we aim to reduce response times, ensure consistent communication quality, and free our team members to focus on specialized tasks requiring human expertise rather than email management.
1.2 Problem Statement
Our organization is struggling with inefficient email management processes that negatively impact operational performance and customer satisfaction. The current manual approach to email triage and routing presents several critical challenges:
Significant time delays occur between receipt and response as emails pass through multiple hands before reaching the appropriate subject matter expert.
Staff members across departments spend excessive time sorting, categorizing, and forwarding emails, diverting resources from high-value work requiring specialized expertise.
Inconsistent handling of similar inquiries results in variable response quality and contradictory information being provided to customers and partners.
Important emails may be overlooked in high-volume periods, leading to missed opportunities or unaddressed critical issues.
The organization lacks visibility into email traffic patterns that could inform staffing decisions and process improvements.
Routine, repetitive inquiries that could be automated consume disproportionate staff attention and resources.
Without an automated solution to streamline email classification and routing, these inefficiencies will continue to create operational bottlenecks, increase response times, and potentially damage our reputation for customer service excellence.
1.3 Current Process
The existing email management process in our organization follows a largely manual workflow that involves multiple touchpoints and handoffs:
Incoming emails arrive at general departmental inboxes (e.g., info@company.com, support@company.com) or to specific team members.
Administrative staff or designated team members manually open, read, and make initial assessments of each email to determine its priority and appropriate handler.
For routine inquiries, staff members search for relevant information across various knowledge bases, documentation, or by consulting colleagues before drafting responses.
More complex or specialized inquiries require forwarding to subject matter experts (SMEs), often involving multiple transfers before reaching the appropriate person.
SMEs must review each email, including the chain of previous communications, to understand the context before responding.
Responses are drafted individually, with limited standardization or templates, leading to inconsistent messaging and varying quality.
Follow-up tracking is managed through ad-hoc methods such as flagging emails, creating calendar reminders, or maintaining separate spreadsheets.
Performance metrics and response time data are collected manually, if at all, providing little insight into operational efficiency or areas for improvement.
During peak periods or staff absences, backlogs develop quickly with no automated prioritization system to ensure critical communications receive prompt attention.
Cross-departmental inquiries often bounce between teams with unclear ownership, further delaying resolution and creating customer frustration.
This labor-intensive process creates significant inefficiencies, delays customer communication, and represents a substantial opportunity cost as skilled staff members devote time to email management rather than applying their expertise to core business functions.
1.4 Scope
The Email Router project encompasses the development, deployment, and integration of an AI-powered email management system that will:
Interface with our existing email infrastructure to capture and process all incoming external communications.
Analyze email content using natural language processing to determine intent, urgency, and required expertise.
Automatically generate responses for routine, standard inquiries based on approved organizational knowledge.
Route complex inquiries to appropriate subject matter experts based on content analysis and defined business rules.
Provide a management dashboard for monitoring system performance, workflow bottlenecks, and response metrics.
Include tools for continuous improvement through feedback loops and model training.

The project scope specifically excludes:
Modifications to existing backend email servers
Processing of internal employee-to-employee communications
Integration with CRM systems (planned for future phase)
Mobile application development (web interface only in initial release)

Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
--No--

**Explanation:**
While the answer is well-structured and each feature follows the required format (Feature Name, Description, Key Functionality, User Benefit), the instruction also states:
> Features must be derived from the provided user stories and should not introduce new functionality beyond the product specification.

However, in this prompt, **no user stories or product specification were provided** for reference. Therefore, I cannot verify whether the features listed are strictly derived from the user stories or if they introduce new, unspecified functionality. Without the original user stories or product specification, it is impossible to confirm compliance with this critical criterion.

If the features were to be evaluated solely on structure and format, the answer would be correct. But since adherence to the source material is required and cannot be verified here, the answer does not fully meet the criteria.
Instructions to fix:
**Correction Instructions:**

1. **Request the Source Material:**
   Before listing or describing product features, ask the user to provide the relevant user stories and/or product specification. This is necessary to ensure that all features are strictly derived from the provided material and do not introduce any new, unspecified functionality.

2. **State the Limitation:**
   Clearly explain that, without access to the user stories or product specification, you cannot verify whether the features are compliant with the requirement to only include functionality described in those sources.

3. **Pause Feature Generation:**
   Do not generate or list any features until the user stories or product specification are provided.

4. **Example Prompt:**
   > "To ensure that the product features are strictly derived from the provided user stories and do not introduce any new, unspecified functionality, please provide the relevant user stories or product specification. Once received, I will generate the features accordingly, ensuring full compliance with your requirements."

**Summary:**
Do not proceed with feature generation or evaluation until the necessary source material (user stories or product specification) is provided. Always clarify this requirement to the user.

--No--

Explanation:
The provided answer does not list any product features in the required structure (Feature Name, Description, Key Functionality, User Benefit). Instead, it requests the user stories or product specification and explains that features cannot be generated without them. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria of providing product features derived from user stories in the specified format.
Instructions to fix:
**Correction Instructions:**

1. **Acknowledge the Requirement:** Briefly acknowledge the need to derive product features strictly from user stories and to avoid introducing unspecified functionality.

2. **Request Source Material (if not provided):** If user stories or product specifications are not provided, politely request them. However, do not stop there.

3. **Demonstrate the Required Output Format:**
   - Provide a sample or template of the required product feature structure:
     - **Feature Name**
     - **Description**
     - **Key Functionality**
     - **User Benefit**
   - Optionally, use placeholder text or a generic example to illustrate the format.

4. **State Next Steps:**
   - Clearly state that once the user stories or product specification are provided, you will generate the product features in the required format, strictly based on the provided material.

**Example Correction:**

To correct your answer, do the following:

- Instead of only requesting the user stories or product specification, also provide a sample of the required product feature format. For example:

---

To generate product features strictly derived from your user stories, please provide the relevant user stories or product specification. Once received, I will create features in the following format:

**Feature Name:**
[Concise name of the feature]

**Description:**
[Brief summary of what the feature does]

**Key Functionality:**
[Main actions or capabilities provided by the feature]

**User Benefit:**
[How this feature benefits the user]

Once you share the user stories or product specification, I will ensure all features are derived directly from them and presented in this structure.

**Note:** Each task may require sub-tasks for backend, frontend, testing, and documentation.
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
--No--

**Explanation:**

The provided answer does not meet the required criteria for the following reasons:

1. **Task Structure Not Followed:**
   The answer lists tasks in bullet points under each feature/user story, but does not use the required structure with explicit fields:
   - Task ID
   - Task Title
   - Related User Story (with the exact user story text)
   - Description
   - Acceptance Criteria
   - Estimated Effort (in hours)
   - Dependencies (by Task ID)

2. **Missing User Story Text:**
   The "Related User Story" field is missing entirely. The answer only uses role/feature headings (e.g., "Customer Support Representative") and feature names, not the exact user story text as required.

3. **No Task IDs:**
   There are no unique Task IDs for tracking purposes.

4. **No Acceptance Criteria:**
   Acceptance criteria are not explicitly listed for each task.

5. **No Estimated Effort:**
   Estimated effort is not provided for any task, and it is required to be in hours.

6. **No Dependencies:**
   Dependencies are not listed for any task, and should reference other Task IDs.

7. **Tasks Not Individually Formatted:**
   Each task should be a standalone, fully specified item as in the example, but the answer groups multiple sub-tasks under each feature without clear separation or full detail.

8. **Potential for Missed Tasks:**
   Because the tasks are grouped and not individually broken out, it is difficult to verify that all required tasks are included and unambiguous.

**Conclusion:**
The answer does not follow the strict formatting and content requirements specified. Each task must be individually listed with all required fields, including the exact user story text, and must include estimated effort in hours and dependencies by Task ID. The provided answer is a high-level breakdown, not a set of fully specified engineering tasks as required.
Instructions to fix:
Certainly! Here are clear instructions to correct the answer so it meets the required criteria:

Email Router
1. Introduction
1.1 Business Overview
Our organization handles a high volume of incoming email communications that require timely, accurate responses across multiple departments. Currently, manual email triage and routing creates bottlenecks, delays customer responses, and consumes valuable staff time that could be directed toward higher-value activities.
Team members spend significant portions of their workday sorting through emails, determining appropriate handlers, and forwarding messages—a process that introduces inconsistency in response quality and timing. Subject matter experts often receive misdirected inquiries, while routine questions that could be automated consume unnecessary attention.
The introduction of the Email Router system addresses these operational challenges by implementing AI-powered email analysis and routing. This solution will integrate with our existing email infrastructure to automatically categorize incoming messages, generate responses for routine inquiries, and intelligently route complex communications to the appropriate subject matter experts.
By implementing this system, we aim to reduce response times, ensure consistent communication quality, and free our team members to focus on specialized tasks requiring human expertise rather than email management.
1.2 Problem Statement
Our organization is struggling with inefficient email management processes that negatively impact operational performance and customer satisfaction. The current manual approach to email triage and routing presents several critical challenges:
Significant time delays occur between receipt and response as emails pass through multiple hands before reaching the appropriate subject matter expert.
Staff members across departments spend excessive time sorting, categorizing, and forwarding emails, diverting resources from high-value work requiring specialized expertise.
Inconsistent handling of similar inquiries results in variable response quality and contradictory information being provided to customers and partners.
Important emails may be overlooked in high-volume periods, leading to missed opportunities or unaddressed critical issues.
The organization lacks visibility into email traffic patterns that could inform staffing decisions and process improvements.
Routine, repetitive inquiries that could be automated consume disproportionate staff attention and resources.
Without an automated solution to streamline email classification and routing, these inefficiencies will continue to create operational bottlenecks, increase response times, and potentially damage our reputation for customer service excellence.
1.3 Current Process
The existing email management process in our organization follows a largely manual workflow that involves multiple touchpoints and handoffs:
Incoming emails arrive at general departmental inboxes (e.g., info@company.com, support@company.com) or to specific team members.
Administrative staff or designated team members manually open, read, and make initial assessments of each email to determine its priority and appropriate handler.
For routine inquiries, staff members search for relevant information across various knowledge bases, documentation, or by consulting colleagues before drafting responses.
More complex or specialized inquiries require forwarding to subject matter experts (SMEs), often involving multiple transfers before reaching the appropriate person.
SMEs must review each email, including the chain of previous communications, to understand the context before responding.
Responses are drafted individually, with limited standardization or templates, leading to inconsistent messaging and varying quality.
Follow-up tracking is managed through ad-hoc methods such as flagging emails, creating calendar reminders, or maintaining separate spreadsheets.
Performance metrics and response time data are collected manually, if at all, providing little insight into operational efficiency or areas for improvement.
During peak periods or staff absences, backlogs develop quickly with no automated prioritization system to ensure critical communications receive prompt attention.
Cross-departmental inquiries often bounce between teams with unclear ownership, further delaying resolution and creating customer frustration.
This labor-intensive process creates significant inefficiencies, delays customer communication, and represents a substantial opportunity cost as skilled staff members devote time to email management rather than applying their expertise to core business functions.
1.4 Scope
The Email Router project encompasses the development, deployment, and integration of an AI-powered email management system that will:
Interface with our existing email infrastructure to capture and process all incoming external communications.
Analyze email content using natural language processing to determine intent, urgency, and required expertise.
Automatically generate responses for routine, standard inquiries based on approved organizational knowledge.
Route complex inquiries to appropriate subject matter experts based on content analysis and defined business rules.
Provide a management dashboard for monitoring system performance, workflow bottlenecks, and response metrics.
Include tools for continuous improvement through feedback loops and model training.

The project scope specifically excludes:
Modifications to existing backend email servers
Processing of internal employee-to-employee communications
Integration with CRM systems (planned for future phase)
Mobile application development (web interface only in initial release)

**End of Project Plan**
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
--No--

Explanation:

While the provided answer is highly detailed and well-structured, it does not fully adhere to the required structure as specified in the criteria. Specifically:

1. User Stories Summary: The plan lists user stories by persona, but does not provide a consolidated summary as required (i.e., a bullet-point list summarizing user needs, as in the example).

2. Feature Breakdown: The plan lists features in a table, but does not explicitly map features to user stories, as required by the criteria ("Features mapped from user stories").

3. Engineering Tasks: The plan provides a detailed task list, but does not show the mapping of tasks to features, which is required for traceability.

4. Dependencies: Dependencies are listed per task, but there is no explicit section summarizing logical ordering and cross-feature dependencies.

5. Milestones / Phases: The plan does provide phases, but does not clearly list delivery milestones as a separate section.

6. Risks & Assumptions: The plan includes a "Risk Management" section, but does not explicitly list assumptions, which are required by the criteria.

7. Strictness: The plan introduces some general project management content (e.g., "Project Governance", "Review & Continuous Improvement") that, while useful, is not strictly required by the criteria and could be considered outside the strict scope.

In summary, while the plan is comprehensive, it does not strictly follow the required structure, particularly in the mapping between user stories, features, and tasks, and in the explicit listing of assumptions. Therefore, it does not fully meet the criteria.
Instructions to fix:
Certainly! Here are clear instructions to correct the answer so it fully meets the required structure and criteria:

---

**1. Add a User Stories Summary Section**

- Create a dedicated section titled **"User Stories Summary"**.
- Provide a concise, bullet-point list summarizing all user needs, as in the example (not just by persona).
- Example format:
  - "As a support rep, I want routine emails auto-answered so I can focus on complex cases."
  - "As an SME, I want to receive only relevant escalations with full context."
  - ...etc.

---

**2. Map Features to User Stories**

- After listing product features, add a **"Feature-to-User Story Mapping"** table or section.
- For each feature, explicitly list which user stories it addresses.
- Example format:

| Feature                        | User Stories Addressed                                 |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Automated Response Handling     | Support Rep: auto-answer, review/approve responses    |
| Email Routing and Classification| SME: receive relevant emails, Support Rep: fast triage|
| ...                             | ...                                                   |

---

**3. Map Engineering Tasks to Features**

- For each engineering task, indicate which feature(s) it implements.
- Add a **"Task-to-Feature Mapping"** table or column in the engineering tasks list.
- Example format:

| Task ID | Task Title                                 | Feature(s) Implemented                |
|---------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| ENG-001 | Develop AI/NLP Module                      | Email Routing and Classification      |
| ENG-002 | Implement Auto-Response Generation         | Automated Response Handling           |
| ...     | ...                                        | ...                                   |

---

**4. Summarize Dependencies in a Dedicated Section**

- Add a section titled **"Dependencies and Logical Ordering"**.
- Summarize key cross-feature and cross-task dependencies, not just per-task.
- Example:
  - "Auto-response generation depends on completion of email classification."
  - "SME routing requires expertise tagging to be in place."
  - ...etc.

---

**5. Add a Milestones / Delivery Phases Section**

- Create a section titled **"Milestones and Delivery Phases"**.
- List major delivery milestones (e.g., "MVP Complete", "Dashboard Live", "Feedback Loop Operational") with expected dates or phase numbers.
- Example:

| Milestone                | Description                                 | Target Date/Phase |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| MVP Complete             | Core ingestion, classification, routing     | End of Month 1    |
| Dashboard Live           | Dashboards and analytics available          | End of Month 2    |
| Feedback Loop Operational| Feedback and retraining in production       | End of Month 3    |

---

**6. Add an Explicit Assumptions Section**

- Create a section titled **"Assumptions"**.
- List all key project assumptions (e.g., "Existing email infrastructure is accessible", "SMEs are available for feedback", "No major changes to compliance requirements during project").
- Example:
  - "SMTP/IMAP access is available for integration."
  - "User roles and permissions are defined before development starts."
  - ...etc.

---

**7. Remove or Minimize Non-Essential Content**

- Remove or condense sections not strictly required by the criteria (e.g., "Project Governance", "Review & Continuous Improvement") unless specifically requested.
- Focus on the required structure: user stories summary, feature breakdown (with mapping), engineering tasks (with mapping), dependencies, milestones, risks, assumptions, and deliverables.

    Product Specification Document
Email Router
1. Introduction
1.1 Business Overview
Our organization handles a high volume of incoming email communications that require timely, accurate responses across multiple departments. Currently, manual email triage and routing creates bottlenecks, delays customer responses, and consumes valuable staff time that could be directed toward higher-value activities.
Team members spend significant portions of their workday sorting through emails, determining appropriate handlers, and forwarding messages—a process that introduces inconsistency in response quality and timing. Subject matter experts often receive misdirected inquiries, while routine questions that could be automated consume unnecessary attention.
The introduction of the Email Router system addresses these operational challenges by implementing AI-powered email analysis and routing. This solution will integrate with our existing email infrastructure to automatically categorize incoming messages, generate responses for routine inquiries, and intelligently route complex communications to the appropriate subject matter experts.
By implementing this system, we aim to reduce response times, ensure consistent communication quality, and free our team members to focus on specialized tasks requiring human expertise rather than email management.
1.2 Problem Statement
Our organization is struggling with inefficient email management processes that negatively impact operational performance and customer satisfaction. The current manual approach to email triage and routing presents several critical challenges:
Significant time delays occur between receipt and response as emails pass through multiple hands before reaching the appropriate subject matter expert.
Staff members across departments spend excessive time sorting, categorizing, and forwarding emails, diverting resources from high-value work requiring specialized expertise.
Inconsistent handling of similar inquiries results in variable response quality and contradictory information being provided to customers and partners.
Important emails may be overlooked in high-volume periods, leading to missed opportunities or unaddressed critical issues.
The organization lacks visibility into email traffic patterns that could inform staffing decisions and process improvements.
Routine, repetitive inquiries that could be automated consume disproportionate staff attention and resources.
Without an automated solution to streamline email classification and routing, these inefficiencies will continue to create operational bottlenecks, increase response times, and potentially damage our reputation for customer service excellence.
1.3 Current Process
The existing email management process in our organization follows a largely manual workflow that involves multiple touchpoints and handoffs:
Incoming emails arrive at general departmental inboxes (e.g., info@company.com, support@company.com) or to specific team members.
Administrative staff or designated team members manually open, read, and make initial assessments of each email to determine its priority and appropriate handler.
For routine inquiries, staff members search for relevant information across various knowledge bases, documentation, or by consulting colleagues before drafting responses.
More complex or specialized inquiries require forwarding to subject matter experts (SMEs), often involving multiple transfers before reaching the appropriate person.
SMEs must review each email, including the chain of previous communications, to understand the context before responding.
Responses are drafted individually, with limited standardization or templates, leading to inconsistent messaging and varying quality.
Follow-up tracking is managed through ad-hoc methods such as flagging emails, creating calendar reminders, or maintaining separate spreadsheets.
Performance metrics and response time data are collected manually, if at all, providing little insight into operational efficiency or areas for improvement.
During peak periods or staff absences, backlogs develop quickly with no automated prioritization system to ensure critical communications receive prompt attention.
Cross-departmental inquiries often bounce between teams with unclear ownership, further delaying resolution and creating customer frustration.
This labor-intensive process creates significant inefficiencies, delays customer communication, and represents a substantial opportunity cost as skilled staff members devote time to email management rather than applying their expertise to core business functions.
1.4 Scope
The Email Router project encompasses the development, deployment, and integration of an AI-powered email management system that will:
Interface with our existing email infrastructure to capture and process all incoming external communications.
Analyze email content using natural language processing to determine intent, urgency, and required expertise.
Automatically generate responses for routine, standard inquiries based on approved organizational knowledge.
Route complex inquiries to appropriate subject matter experts based on content analysis and defined business rules.
Provide a management dashboard for monitoring system performance, workflow bottlenecks, and response metrics.
Include tools for continuous improvement through feedback loops and model training.

The project scope specifically excludes:
Modifications to existing backend email servers
Processing of internal employee-to-employee communications
Integration with CRM systems (planned for future phase)
Mobile application development (web interface only in initial release)

**End of Project Plan**
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
--No--

Explanation:

The provided answer is very thorough and well-structured, but it does not fully meet the required structure as specified in the criteria. Specifically:

1. **Missing Project Overview**: There is no explicit "Project Overview" section at the beginning that provides a high-level summary of the product and its goals. The plan starts directly with "User Stories Summary." The criteria require a clear Project Overview as the first section.

2. **Risks & Assumptions**: While both "Assumptions" and "Risks" are present, they are listed as separate sections (sections 6 and 8). The criteria specify a combined "Risks & Assumptions" section.

3. **Section Order**: The order of sections does not strictly follow the required structure. The required order is: Project Overview, User Stories Summary, Feature Breakdown, Engineering Tasks, Dependencies, Milestones/Phases, Risks & Assumptions. The provided plan has "Assumptions" before "Deliverables" and "Risks" after "Deliverables," which is not as per the required structure.

4. **Feature Breakdown**: The plan provides "Product Features" and a "Feature-to-User Story Mapping," which is acceptable, but the section is not explicitly titled "Feature Breakdown." However, this is a minor naming issue and could be considered acceptable.

5. **No New Scope**: The plan does not introduce new scope and is internally consistent.

**Summary**: The main issue is the absence of a Project Overview section and the separation of Risks and Assumptions, which are required to be combined. Therefore, the answer does not fully meet the criteria.
Instructions to fix:
Certainly! Here are clear instructions to correct the answer so it fully meets the required structure and criteria:

---

**1. Add a "Project Overview" Section at the Beginning**

- Insert a new section at the very start, titled **"Project Overview"**.
- This section should provide a concise, high-level summary of the Email Router project, its purpose, and its main goals. (Use only the information already provided in the rest of the plan.)

**2. Combine "Risks" and "Assumptions" into a Single Section**

- Merge the current "Assumptions" (section 6) and "Risks" (section 8) into a single section titled **"Risks & Assumptions"**.
- Place this combined section in the correct order as specified below.

**3. Reorder Sections to Match the Required Structure**

Rearrange the sections to strictly follow this order:

1. Project Overview
2. User Stories Summary
3. Feature Breakdown (you may keep your "Product Features" and "Feature-to-User Story Mapping" here, but title the section "Feature Breakdown")
4. Engineering Tasks
5. Dependencies and Logical Ordering
6. Milestones and Delivery Phases
7. Risks & Assumptions

**4. Remove or Relocate "Deliverables"**

- The required structure does not include a separate "Deliverables" section. If you wish to retain this information, integrate it into the "Milestones and Delivery Phases" section or omit it.

**5. Section Naming Consistency**

- Ensure section titles match the required structure exactly (e.g., "Feature Breakdown" instead of "Product Features").

**6. Do Not Add New Scope**

- Do not introduce any new features, user stories, or requirements not already present in the original answer.

---

**Summary of Required Corrections:**

- Add a "Project Overview" at the top.
- Combine "Risks" and "Assumptions" into "Risks & Assumptions."
- Reorder all sections to match the required structure.
- Rename sections for consistency.
- Remove or integrate "Deliverables" as appropriate.
- Do not add new content or scope.

    Product Specification Document
Email Router
1. Introduction
1.1 Business Overview
Our organization handles a high volume of incoming email communications that require timely, accurate responses across multiple departments. Currently, manual email triage and routing creates bottlenecks, delays customer responses, and consumes valuable staff time that could be directed toward higher-value activities.
Team members spend significant portions of their workday sorting through emails, determining appropriate handlers, and forwarding messages—a process that introduces inconsistency in response quality and timing. Subject matter experts often receive misdirected inquiries, while routine questions that could be automated consume unnecessary attention.
The introduction of the Email Router system addresses these operational challenges by implementing AI-powered email analysis and routing. This solution will integrate with our existing email infrastructure to automatically categorize incoming messages, generate responses for routine inquiries, and intelligently route complex communications to the appropriate subject matter experts.
By implementing this system, we aim to reduce response times, ensure consistent communication quality, and free our team members to focus on specialized tasks requiring human expertise rather than email management.
1.2 Problem Statement
Our organization is struggling with inefficient email management processes that negatively impact operational performance and customer satisfaction. The current manual approach to email triage and routing presents several critical challenges:
Significant time delays occur between receipt and response as emails pass through multiple hands before reaching the appropriate subject matter expert.
Staff members across departments spend excessive time sorting, categorizing, and forwarding emails, diverting resources from high-value work requiring specialized expertise.
Inconsistent handling of similar inquiries results in variable response quality and contradictory information being provided to customers and partners.
Important emails may be overlooked in high-volume periods, leading to missed opportunities or unaddressed critical issues.
The organization lacks visibility into email traffic patterns that could inform staffing decisions and process improvements.
Routine, repetitive inquiries that could be automated consume disproportionate staff attention and resources.
Without an automated solution to streamline email classification and routing, these inefficiencies will continue to create operational bottlenecks, increase response times, and potentially damage our reputation for customer service excellence.
1.3 Current Process
The existing email management process in our organization follows a largely manual workflow that involves multiple touchpoints and handoffs:
Incoming emails arrive at general departmental inboxes (e.g., info@company.com, support@company.com) or to specific team members.
Administrative staff or designated team members manually open, read, and make initial assessments of each email to determine its priority and appropriate handler.
For routine inquiries, staff members search for relevant information across various knowledge bases, documentation, or by consulting colleagues before drafting responses.
More complex or specialized inquiries require forwarding to subject matter experts (SMEs), often involving multiple transfers before reaching the appropriate person.
SMEs must review each email, including the chain of previous communications, to understand the context before responding.
Responses are drafted individually, with limited standardization or templates, leading to inconsistent messaging and varying quality.
Follow-up tracking is managed through ad-hoc methods such as flagging emails, creating calendar reminders, or maintaining separate spreadsheets.
Performance metrics and response time data are collected manually, if at all, providing little insight into operational efficiency or areas for improvement.
During peak periods or staff absences, backlogs develop quickly with no automated prioritization system to ensure critical communications receive prompt attention.
Cross-departmental inquiries often bounce between teams with unclear ownership, further delaying resolution and creating customer frustration.
This labor-intensive process creates significant inefficiencies, delays customer communication, and represents a substantial opportunity cost as skilled staff members devote time to email management rather than applying their expertise to core business functions.
1.4 Scope
The Email Router project encompasses the development, deployment, and integration of an AI-powered email management system that will:
Interface with our existing email infrastructure to capture and process all incoming external communications.
Analyze email content using natural language processing to determine intent, urgency, and required expertise.
Automatically generate responses for routine, standard inquiries based on approved organizational knowledge.
Route complex inquiries to appropriate subject matter experts based on content analysis and defined business rules.
Provide a management dashboard for monitoring system performance, workflow bottlenecks, and response metrics.
Include tools for continuous improvement through feedback loops and model training.

The project scope specifically excludes:
Modifications to existing backend email servers
Processing of internal employee-to-employee communications
Integration with CRM systems (planned for future phase)
Mobile application development (web interface only in initial release)
